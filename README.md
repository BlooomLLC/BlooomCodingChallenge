# Blooom Coding Challenge

Welcome to Blooom Coding Challenge! 

## Rules
The rules for this contest are simple: create a simple iPhone app using Swift, Xcode, and Firebase that Signs Up and Signs In new users. Sign Up/Sign In methods that we prefer are email/password, phone, and Instagram (you can use Firebase Authentication for this). In addition, we require that **name**, **age**, and **school** are collected from users on Sign Up and stored using either Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore. 

## Submittion
Submit your code by creating a Pull Request to this project. We've provided some starter code to help you get started. You are not required to use the starter code nor are you required to follow the organizational pattern that we provided. 

## Winner and Prize
The winners will be judged by project organization, timing, and code readability. The winner of this challenge will receive a **$200** reward via Venmo or Cashapp.

## Helpful Hints
When you clone this repo for the first time, in Terminal navigate to the head of this directory and type `pod install` to install the Firebase dependencies. If running this command causes an error, it's probably because you do not have CocoaPods installed on your Mac. To install this follow the instructions on this website http://cocoapods.org/.<br /><br />

You will need to create your own FREE Firebase account and download a **GoogleService-Info.plist** file to add into your project. You can delete your **GoogleService-Info.plist** file when your ready to upload your pull request.<br /><br />

**Here are some helpful links. You should not have to use any other Firebase tools outside of what we linked below. Use the iOS docs in Swift:**<br />
